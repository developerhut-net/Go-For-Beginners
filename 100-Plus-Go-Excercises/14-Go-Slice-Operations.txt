14. Slice Operations

Goal: Practice common slice operations.

1. Create a slice with 5 numbers and print a sub-slice (first 3 numbers).

2. Append multiple values to a slice in one statement.

3. Copy a slice into another slice using copy().

4. Remove the second element from a slice (using slicing and append).

5. Create a slice, modify one element, and show that it changes in the original array (if created from array).
