3. Go Variables â€“ Declare Multiple Variables

Goal: Learn to declare multiple variables in one line.

1. Declare two variables firstName and lastName in one line, then print them.

2. Create three integer variables (x, y, z) in one line and print their sum.

3. Declare multiple variables of different types (e.g., city, population, isCapital) and print them.

4. Assign values to two variables in a single statement using :=.

5. Declare three variables in one line without assigning values, then assign later.
