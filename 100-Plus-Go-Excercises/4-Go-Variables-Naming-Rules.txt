4. Go Variables – Naming Rules

Goal: Understand valid and invalid variable names.

1. Create variables with camelCase names like studentName and print them.

2. Try declaring a variable starting with _ (underscore) and use it.

3. Show an invalid variable name (like 2name) in comments and explain why it’s wrong.

4. Write a program with two variables: one with a clear name (age) and one with a bad name (a). Print both to compare.

5. Create a variable with a multi-word name (e.g., favoriteFood) and print it.
